       "AIMessageChunk(content=\"For a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala, you can substitute the chicken with a plant-based alternative such as tofu or paneer. Here's how you can prepare the tofu or paneer as a replacement for the chicken:\\n\\n**Tofu:**\\n1. Use firm or extra firm tofu for this recipe. Press the tofu to remove excess water by wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel and placing a heavy object on top for about 15-20 minutes.\\n2. Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and follow the marination process as you would with the chicken. Tofu absorbs flavors well, so marinate it for at least 1 hour, preferably longer.\\n3. Instead of baking, you can pan-fry the marinated tofu in a bit of oil until it's golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside.\\n\\n**Paneer:**\\n1. Paneer is a type of Indian cheese that holds its shape well when cooked. You can either buy it pre-made or make it at home by curdling hot milk with lemon juice or vinegar, then straining the curds.\\n2. Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes and follow the marination process as you would with the chicken. Paneer doesn't need as much marination time as tofu, so 30 minutes should be sufficient.\\n3. Instead of baking, you can pan-fry the marinated paneer in a bit of oil until it's lightly browned on all sides.\\n\\nBy using tofu or paneer as a substitute for chicken, you can still enjoy the rich and flavorful Chicken Tikka Masala with a vegetarian twist.\")"
