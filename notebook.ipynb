      "\n",
      "### Financial Overview\n",
      "#### Income Statement Highlights (for the most recent period):\n",
      "- **Total Revenue**: $1,296,745,000\n",
      "- **Net Income**: -$183,949,000\n",
      "- **Gross Profit**: $989,740,000\n",
      "- **Operating Income**: -$185,485,000\n",
      "- **EBITDA**: -$36,170,000\n",
      "- **Basic/Diluted EPS**: -$0.55\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Balance Sheet Highlights:\n",
      "- **Total Assets**: $2,759,767,000\n",
      "- **Total Liabilities**: $1,996,720,000\n",
      "- **Stockholders' Equity**: $763,047,000\n",
      "- **Net Debt**: $1,196,498,000\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recent Stock Performance (Last 100 Days):\n",
      "- **Recent Price Range**: ~$76 to ~$86\n",
      "- **Most Recent Closing Price**: $79.34 (tendency to fluctuate with market conditions)\n",
      "- **No Dividends or Stock Splits**: Cloudflare has not paid dividends or had stock splits in the recent period\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis\n",
      "- **Revenue Growth**: The company has shown strong revenue growth over time, as evident from the rising total revenue figures.\n",
      "- **Profitability Issues**: Cloudflare is currently operating at a net loss, with negative net income and basic/diluted EPS. This is not unusual for companies investing in their growth, but it is a risk factor to consider.\n",
      "- **Liabilities vs. Equity**: Total liabilities are quite high compared to equity, leading to a significant net debt position.\n",
      "- **Stock Performance**: The stock has been experiencing a broad range in pricing with some volatility, which might be driven by broader market trends and company-specific news.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "Cloudflare appears to be in a growth phase, focusing on increasing revenue with ongoing investments. However, the lack of profitability and substantial debt levels might be a concern for risk-averse investors. If you are a long-term investor with a higher risk tolerance and belief in cloud technology and infrastructure, Cloudflare might offer potential due to its market position and revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is advisable to combine this financial analysis with other market information, such as industry trends, competitive positioning, and macroeconomic factors, to make a more informed decision. Also consider consulting financial advisors before investing.\n"
